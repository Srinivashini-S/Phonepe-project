# Phonepe-project
Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

Data Extraction: Clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository using git clone command. Load the data into a Pandas dataframe using libraries such as Pandas or csv. Preprocess the data and perform any necessary cleaning and transformation steps.

Database Management: Set up a POSTGRESQL database to store the processed data. Connect to the database using the library psycopg2 from python. Create a table in the database to store the data. Insert the data into the table using SQL commands.

Visualization and Dashboard Creation: The data is then analyzed and visualized using the plotly and streamlit packages. The data is presented in various graph formats such as aggregated transactions, users, top transactions, and users for state, pincode, and district. The streamlit webpage allows the user to interact with the data and explore the different graphs, allowing for a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns within the data. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of PhonePe's transaction data, allowing for insights into the growth and trends of digital payments in India over the past five years.
